This is my solution to the Kaggle competition titled "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster"

The challenge, as listed on the Kaggle website, is as follows:

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

The data for this challenge is split into a training set and a test set, along with an example submission. The training and test set contain the following features:

- survival, which indicates whether a passenger survived or not, and has values:	0 = No and a 1 = Yes
- pclass, which indicates which class a passenger is sitting in, and has values:	1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
- sex, which indicates which Sex a passenger is
- age, which indicates a passenger's age in years
- sibsp, which indicates number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic a passenger has
- parch, which indicates numer of parents/children aboard the Titanic a passenger has
- ticket, while indicates a passenger's ticket number
- fare, which indicates the amount of money (fare) a passenger paid
- cabin, which indicates the Cabin number the passenger is staying in
- embarked, which indicates the	Port of Embarkation the passenger took off from, and has values:	C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
